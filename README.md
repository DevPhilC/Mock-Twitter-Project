# Mock-Twitter-Project

Hey there! In this project, I made mock version of twitter, show casing the profiles of Elon Musk and Bill Gates. This project was used with Vanilla Javascript.

To see how this works, run the code in an https-server, and in the address bar add this string "/?user=elonMusk" to the end of the address. This will bring up Elon's profile.

To see Gate's profile, type "/?user=billGates".

Have fun!!!!!
